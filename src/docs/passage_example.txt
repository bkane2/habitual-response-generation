Lissa's grandmother used to bake the most wonderful pies on Saturdays. She would go to the orchard on Shady Lane early in the morning. She used to pick a basket of apples and peaches. Then she would go into the kitchen and shoo everyone else away. About 4 o'clock an irresistible aroma wafted through the entire house.
