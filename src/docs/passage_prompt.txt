A "generic passage" is a short passage about a recurring type of event, where each subsequent sentence describes how that event would typically occur. Given a fact describing a recurring event, generate a generic passage. Use a first person subject for the passage. Interpret the fact literally. If the fact doesn't describe an event, then create a passage for an event consistent with that fact.
