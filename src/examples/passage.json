    "passage" : "My grandmother used to bake the most wonderful pies on Saturdays. She would go to the orchard on Shady Lane early in the morning. She used to pick a basket of apples and peaches. Then she would go into the kitchen and  shoo everyone else away. About 4 o'clock an irresistible aroma wafted through the entire house."

    "fact" : "I like to go hunting.",
    "passage" : "I go hunting pretty often. The first step I take is deciding what kind of animal to hunt, depending on my location and the season. I then get my firearm and bow, as well as some camouflage clothing, boots, and a hunting knife. Once I'm on the hunt, I try to identify the target carefully, track the animal, and wait patiently for the perfect shot. The true joy of hunting for me is not just in the kill, but also in the beauty of my natural surroundings and the time spent outdoors."
